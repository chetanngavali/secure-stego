# secure-stego
This Python tool offers secure steganography by encrypting text with AEAD (ChaCha20-Poly1305 or AES-256-GCM) and embedding it in image pixels using cryptographically secure random ordering. Only the correct password unlocks hidden messages, making it ideal for private communication and strong data protection.
